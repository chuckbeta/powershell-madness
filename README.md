DCM2 TASK 1: PERSONAL LEADERSHIP EVALUATION

## Introduction

Developing one's leadership style is paramount in becoming a successful leader in today's corporate environment. Having the introspection to understand your strengths and weaknesses will empower you by gaining insight into where you need to develop to become a better leader. The task calls for me to reflect on the results of the CliftonStengths Assessment, an assessment taken online at the beginning of the course. I will also use a scholarly leadership theory to evaluate my strengths and weaknesses of my leadership style. Lastly, I will develop short-term goals, adhering to the SMART \(Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Based\) criteria to help me develop two actions to achieve those goals.

### A. Signature Themes Report

 The CliftonStrengths assessment is a tool developed to help students identify and apply a set of five top strengths to become a more effective leader. The assessment evaluates responses based on thirty-four different strengths structured across four domain areas. The domain areas are Executing, Influencing, Relationship Building, and Strategic Thinking. In this section, I will outline my five strengths to understand better how they apply to my personality and effectiveness as a leader.

### A1. Reflection on CliftonStrengths

The CliftonStrengths assessment report outlined my top five strengths: Relator, Deliberative, Adaptability, Futuristic, and Strategic. This assessment is a good outline of my strengths, not only as a leader but as a person; these strengths align with my personality. When reflecting on these strengths, I always envision how my attributes coincide with my professional life and vice versa. These are the core values that I strive to follow, and I was not surprised by the results of this assessment.

#### Relator

 The relator theme, found under the relationship-building domain, is about connecting with people more intimately. The relator does not seek out new connections but will not turn away anyone. The relator will also be deliberate in their relationship, ensuring the connections are on the same page. I find that this theme accurately reflects my biggest strength. I am very deliberate in whom I let in my inner circle. Just as in my personal life, I choose my connections wisely professionally, always allowing those new to my circle to prove themselves. Once proven, I continuously encourage them to follow my lead and move the needle forward when working on a project. If I find someone lingering behind, I go to them and use my influence to help break through any of the hesitations or obstacles they may have. The relationships built are personal and have led to successful connections that last many years.

#### Deliberative

 The deliberative theme, found under the executing domain, demonstrates my ability to take caution when making decisions. The deliberative person looks at all the angles in a given situation and weighs the risks. Taking care when making choices is another defining attribute of the deliberative theme. Just as in the relator theme, the assessment aligns with my actions when making decisions. I do not run away from risks. I measure them carefully and make a decision based on the information provided. With this theme falling under the executing domain, I am the person that makes things happen. Leadership and my peers turn to me to get things done correctly and on time, a quality that makes a strong leader.

#### Adaptability

 The adaptability theme, falling under the relationship-building domain, promotes a leader as someone who can adapt to what comes at them. The leader thrives in the unforeseen detours in business and will consider it as the nature of business. Never turning away a request, the adaptable leader stays productive even in a storm of the chaos of change. While the CliftonStrengths assessment categorizes the adaptability theme under the relationship-building domain, I firmly believe that it should fall under the executing domain. This is because most flexible leaders tend to deliver on goals set by or for them continually. I am a genuinely adaptable leader and have thrown away a plan after months of preparation when someone proposes a plan that works more efficiently. The logic behind this is that to deploy a new solution one must be adaptable to their environment.

####  Futuristic

 One of the strategic thinking domain themes that the assessment has outlined is that futuristic leaders have a longer-term vision for their business or product lines. The futurist leader will tell their story on their future visions and will always look at milestones months down the line. I have always been a futurist and energized those around me to take the journey to the future. As leaders, we must constantly push our teams forward. While there is never a loss for things to do in the current environment, leaders must ensure that teams do not become complacent in their tasks. They are striving to push the team forward for the betterment of the organization or the team. Being a futurist is what I want to accomplish as a leader going forward.

#### Strategic

 The final theme, also in the strategic thinking domain, is the strategic leader. This theme is aligned with a leader who can instinctively see through the noise and take the organization's best path forward. This leader will forgo paths that lead to nowhere and navigate the confusion, two pillars that can quickly derail progress forward. As a leader in my current field, I work diligently on silencing the noise and choosing the best path forward for any given solution. I agreed that this is one of my best strengths that has allowed me to succeed in my current profession.

## B. Leadership Evaluation

 The CliftonStrengths assessment defined the attributes that were aligned more closely to my leadership ability. In this evaluation section, I will evaluate three strengths and weaknesses of my leadership ability and relate them to the situational leadership theory. The situational leadership theory purports that there is no single universal method of leadership. It continues to specify that the leaders can adapt to the needs of an organization based on the situation they are facing, adjusting their leadership style as they encounter different scenarios. Finally, the situational leadership theory suggests that leaders should adapt to match the "â€¦maturity or readiness of the employee". \(Gier, 2018, p. 5\)

### B1. Personal Leadership Strengths

 Adaptability is a critical attribute for a situational leader. According to Chapman, "Much of being a great leader is identifying difficult situations and knowing how to navigate those. And as it pertains to people management, the best of the best know how to handle the personalities they deal with situationally." \(Chapman, 2018, p. 16\) Having the ability to navigate the personalities that I have managed or encountered has led me to succeed throughout my career. Working with various personnel from administrative staff to C-level executives, my ability to adapt my communication style or demeanor enables me to work with those across the business. Being able to react to specific situations as they come with these personalities, especially as I move up the corporate ladder, determines my future success.

 My other strengths that align well with each other under the situational leadership theory are deliberative and strategic. With situational leadership theory focused on the leader's ability to adapt, being deliberative allows the leader to assess the situation and make decisions accordingly. With every decision made, my adaptability plays a pivotal role in the success or failure of that choice. As a situational leader, the employee's willingness also plays an important role. In the Situational Leadership Model \(Geir, 2018\), there are four readiness levels an employee will have before they are willing to perform any given task. Accordingly, situational leaders will find themselves adapting their styles based on those readiness levels.

 By being deliberate in my decisions, I can align them with the readiness of a peer or subordinate to perform any given task based on their level of willingness. This ability to encourage people within an organization further strengthens my ability to be more strategic and decisive. Allowing me to paint a picture for the employee of the company's future will hopefully show them that we are all in this together to better everyone. Inclusion in an organization's strategic plans has allowed me to ensure employees are willing to move the needle forward and accomplish many tasks. These strengths are the key to my success in my current profession.

### B2. Personal Leadership Weaknesses

 Situational leadership effectiveness relies on the relationship between leader and employee, more specifically, the willingness of the employee to perform. \(Geir, 2018\) The situation leader will have to shift their style based on this employee willingness, and I see this as one weakness using this theory. When I encounter an unwilling or insecure employee to perform a task and spend an extended amount of time with that employee to sell them on that task, I will become extremely frustrated. This aligns with one of my strengths under the executing domain. Leaders with attributes in the executing domain, in my case deliberative, will work tirelessly to accomplish a task.

When I encounter completely unwilling employees, I tend to do the work myself. This unwillingness takes away my time from working on more strategic tasks for the organization. This action contradicts the situational leadership theory based on the implementation of alternative actions "â€¦such as intentionally do not intervene, take no definite action, avoid confrontation, leave things alone, and leave the group aloneâ€¦". \(Graeff, 1983, p. 288\) It seems counterintuitive to me, as a leader, to not act and leave things alone. It feels like that I am not an effective leader by doing this. This is one of the primary reasons I find this to be one of my most significant weaknesses.

The other weaknesses I find that impacts my effectiveness as a leader is that I have a robust and analytical mind. I have the drive to analyze and challenge employees that may make them feel unwilling to perform under my leadership. Under situational leadership, an effective leader will need a willing employee. Continuously analyzing and challenging employees, I can become more of a dictator than a leader. Experience has shown me that this behavior will directly impact my relator ability with employees and will require me to be more attentive to my interactions with the team.

### B3. Recommendations for Personal Leadership

 This task calls for three actionable recommendations to improve my leadership effectiveness and relate to situational leadership theory. I have already defined my weaknesses in the previous section; frustration when working with unwilling employees, always challenging, and not just leaving it to unwilling employees to accomplish a task. These three weaknesses will allow me to develop the following actionable tasks that will improve the effectiveness of my leadership: increase my awareness, ask questions in the right way, and develop peripheral vision.

#### Increase My Awareness

 Being aware will be my greatest challenge when dealing with unwilling employees. As a leader, I find myself relying on information from others to decide. At times, I do not find enough opportunity to work with employees as closely as possible and let the managers delegate. By taking time to engage with the team more closely, I will increase my awareness of those who will be the most unwilling. Leaders sometimes isolate themselves from the overall team, leading to incomplete information when receiving updates from their direct reports. \(Shaw, 2014\) Increasing my awareness will directly improve my efficiency.

#### Ask Questions in the Right Way

 Leaders often see what they want to see based on their existing beliefs. \(Shaw, 2014\) By asking questions that may go against my own beliefs about a project or task, I will be able to clearly understand the obstacles that may be in the way of success. As I increase my awareness, asking questions in the right way based on the situation will allow me to make decisions more effectively. The ability to ask the right question will also improve employee willingness. The employees will see that their leader is also willing to understand better the situations they are facing during a given project or task.

#### Develop Peripheral Vision

 Having been assess the relator theme as part of the CliftonStrengths assessment, I can build relationships with people. Sometimes those relationships do not always extend to those in the lower ranks of an organization. My last action would be to break out of my inner circle of influence and use my relator ability to get to know everyone within the team. This will allow me to build that peripheral vision that will allow me to make better decisions. Using the views of everyone within the team, not only from the inner circle of influence, I can make more informed decisions. This is possibly the most lasting and impactful improvement I can make to be a more effective leader.

## C. Smart Goals

 The final task involves building two short-term goals to improve my overall leadership. These goals will follow the SMART \(Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, and Time-Bound\) criteria, allowing me to be accountable and ensuring I will achieve them within the period I set forth here. These two short-term goals will be to graduate from the WGU MBA program by May of 2022 and take one complimentary leadership course offered to me by my place of employment every quarter. Following these two goals, I will be a more effective and successful leader.

### C1. Specific Actions

 Accomplishing a graduation date of May 2022, I have already begun allocating six hours per day to focus on the courses required. By devoting this time to achieve the tasks outline in each course, I am already on a path to success to meet this goal. The second action I can take to achieve this goal is to continue working with my program mentor on the degree plan and ensure that the schedule continues to drive towards completion in May of 2022. I am meeting weekly with my program mentor and email her whenever I have questions about the program. These two actions will allow me to graduate within the period I set for myself.

 The second goal was to take one leadership course from Havard Business Mentor every quarter. The courses are part of the standard benefits package within my company, but I never took advantage of that. The courses are short enough not to interfere with my WGU workload and complement the plethora of resources already provided to me by WGU. I have already allocated time, one hour per month, on my work calendar to take these courses. This will ensure there will be no conflict with my daily work schedule. I will also inform my direct line manager about my intent to take these courses and add them to my objectives for the year. This will be measured twice yearly as part of our company's Human Resources policy around performance reviews.

## Conclusion

 As this task ends, I find myself reflecting on everything I have learned up to this point. My journey is a long one and will require dedication and grit. I find it a great challenge to take and leveraging the tools I have learned in this first task, I know I will be ready to be a successful student. Not only will I be a successful student, but I will be a more competent and effective leader for any organization. Leaders are born through perseverance, and I am ready to persevere.
