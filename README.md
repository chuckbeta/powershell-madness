# powershell-madness
Repo for all my powershell scripts. 

I previously used Google Drive, One Drive, Box and a bunch of other shares to store this stuff in. Not sure why I never
migrated to GitHub. I guess I never understood what it was for, since I wasn't that "true" developer.

Once I started playing with Puppet at work and seeing what Github can do for me, I realized that this is where all my scripts
need to live.

# Caveat
After working with Powershell since 2008, I'm still in intermediate mindset. :)
